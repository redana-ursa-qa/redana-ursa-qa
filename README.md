## About me

👋 Hello! I'm a **QA Engineer with over 3 years of experience** testing web, desktop, mobile, and hardware-based solutions. 
I work with requirements, design test documentation, perform API testing and help improve QA processes within the team.
I’ve led projects as the sole QA specialist, built testing practices from scratch, prepared products for release, interviewed candidates, and trained junior QA engineers.

🌱 Currently, I’m learning **test automation with Python** (Pytest, Playwright) and aiming to expand my expertise in automated and integration testing. 

📍 Based in Spain, open to remote opportunities worldwide.
